## About
Most of the websites content is filled in dynamically in #root div except for nav and footer.
I used jquery and bootstrap grid to make it responsive. The content can be found in pagesContents.js file.
In app.js file you will find all the functions I used to make this happen. I used window.location.hash for 
navigation. Ex.. #no-results. Added 5 pages - Main, Loading, Results, No-results, and 404 page.
